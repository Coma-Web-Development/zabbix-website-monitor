# Linux requirements
- Unix or Linux environment
- Packages: curl, wget, awk, bash, nodejs, yarn, chromium, bc

Centos 7.x commands:
```bash
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install curl wget chromium
curl â€“sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
yum -y install nodejs gcc-c++ make yarn bc
yarn global add lighthouse
```

# Hosts list
You need to create a hosts list to be monitored and make it available through some http server, because the script use curl to make some testes.
The hosts list standard:
```bash
url;protocol;
# or
url:8080;protocol;
```

All empty or commented lines started with "#" will be ignored. Eventually invalid lines will be filtered to be ignored to avoid problems.

A real example of host conf file:
```bash
google.com;https;
bing.com;http;
example:8090;https;
example2:3000;http;
```

The script that read the hosts lists files is the

```bash
zabbix_websitemonitor_lld_sites.sh
```

file. It will read the hosts files and generate a JSON in Zabbix LLD standard. The parameters will be the URL's (one or more) of hosts that you want to monitor.

Real example:
```bash
zabbix_websitemonitor_lld_sites.sh https://example.com/hosts.txt http://example2:8080/hosts.txt https://example.example3.net/domains.txt
```
