# Linux requirements
- Unix or Linux environment
- Hosts list file to be monitored
- Packages: curl, wget, awk, bash, nodejs, yarn, chromium, bc

Centos 7.x commands:
```bash
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install curl wget chromium
curl â€“sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
yum -y install nodejs gcc-c++ make yarn bc
yarn global add lighthouse
```

**Note:** yarn, lighthouse, nodejs and related packages are only needed if you want create reports about performance.

# Hosts list file

You have to create two files.

1. The "URL hosts list" that contain all sites to be monitored, one by line.
2. The directory with files that contain the files with the URL to download the "URL host list". It will be called "Host list files".


**The "URL hosts list" standard:**
```bash
url;protocol;
# or
url:8080;protocol;
```

All empty or commented lines started with "#" will be ignored. Eventually invalid lines will be filtered to be ignored to avoid problems.

A real example of host conf file:
```bash
# https://example.com/hosts.txt file example
google.com;https;
bing.com;http;
example:8090;https;
example2:3000;http;
```

It will read the hosts files and generate a JSON in Zabbix LLD standard. The parameters will be the URL's (one or more) of hosts that you want to monitor.

**The "Host list files" standard:**

```bash
https://example.com/hosts.txt
https://example2.com/hosts.txt
```

**How it will work?**
The Zabbix LLD script, that will discover all the URLs to be monitored, will read all the "Host list files" to get all URLs that contain the hosts to be monitored. Then it will access all the "Host list files" URLs to download the final list of hosts to be monitored.

**Why do that in two steps?**
To avoid you lose your "Host list files" when you update the Zabbix LLD script and to provide a way to load all of them from only one directory. And will be more easier only config one directoy instead of a lot of "URL hosts list".


# Documentation

## How to install

1. Import the template file to your zabbix server (check the zabbix_template dir)

```bash
zabbix_website_monitor_.xml
```

2. Copy the zabbix scripts to your zabbix scripts dir (check the zabbix_scripts dir) in the server that will monitor your sites.

By default, it come configured to be installed on /opt/zabbix/. Do not forget to provide executable permission to the owner and fix the owner/group to zabbix:zabbix.

**Important**: Configure the 

```bash
url_list_files=
```

variable with the absolute path that contain all **"URL host files"** that will be read to get all **"URL hosts list"**.

3. Copy the zabbix conf file (check the zabbix_conf dir) to the conf dir of zabbix agent that will monitor the sites. Usually the dir is:
```bash
/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/
``` 

**Notes:**
- Check the correct zabbix agent dir conf location.
- You need to restart the zabbix-agent to load the conf file
- If you will use other directory different of /opt/zabbix/ to install the scripts, you need to change the absolute path of he scripts in the file

```bash
zabbix_website_monitor.conf
```

To restart the the Zabbix agent:

```bash
systemctl restart zabbix-agent
```

## How to update

1. Backup your template, your zabbix scripts dir and the zabbix conf file.

2. To update the scripts, you only have to copy the content of the below dir to your zabbix script directory.

**Important:** If the Hosts list file is in different path from default (/opt/zabbix/zabbix_webmonitor_hosts_list.txt), you have to update the file.

```bash
zabbix_scripts
``` 

3. To update the zabbix agent conf file, you need to override the new version in the zabbix agent conf directoy.

**Important:** You need to change the scripts directory if you use a custom directory (different from /opt/zabbix). After copy the new files, you need restart the zabbix-agent.

4. Import again the template and override the old one.

**Important:** If you customized anything, we recommend export your template and manually edit the XML file to add the new features. If you know how to use git patch, will be easier than do manual edit.

4. 

## How to remove

1. Delete the template from your zabbix dashboard.
2. Delete the scripts that you copied from the git.
3. Remove the zabbix-agent conf file and restart zabbix-agent.
